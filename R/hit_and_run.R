#' Hit and Run 
#' 
#' Given Ax <= b, this function samples from the convex polytope
#' using the hit-and-run algorithm
#' 
#' @param A is the lhs of the inequation Ax <= b
#' @param b is the rhs of the inequation Ax <= b
#' @param x0 is the starting point, must be within the convex polytope
#' @param n is the number of points we want to sample
#' 
#' @return a matrix, with the columns as points sampled
#' 
#' @export
