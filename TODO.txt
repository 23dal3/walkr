Probably unnecessary, but for your reference: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/set-up.html. 

Confirm that things are working by submitting a PR which adds your name to the bottom of this file.

Useful reference for R Packages: https://r-pkgs.org/ Probably worthwhile to read Chapter 1, at least if you have not created R packages before.

Two tasks to work on. Not sure which to do first. Should be separate PRs, obviously.

### Get Package to Pass R CMD check

### Translate Vignette from rmw to qmd format
