Probably unnecessary, but for your reference: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/set-up.html. 

Confirm that things are working by submitting a PR which adds your name to the bottom of this file.

Useful reference for R Packages: https://r-pkgs.org/ Probably worthwhile to read Chapter 1, at least if you have not created R packages before.

Two tasks to work on. Should be separate PRs, obviously.

### Translate Vignette from rmw to qmd format

Rnw is the old format for writing text and R code. Quarto is the new recommended format. It is a flavor of markdown.

Don't feel the need to make the new output look like the old output. Quarto looks different. But we do want all the substance: formulas, citation and so on. Can probably get rid of lots of old junk files.

### Get Package to Pass R CMD check

RStudio makes looking at this issue easy.

Could be that getting rid of the Rnw vignette makes this easy.

The error I get is:
