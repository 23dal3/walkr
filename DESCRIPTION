Description: Samples from the intersection of the n-simplex and m hyperplanes using MCMC random walks. 
             Specifically, the sampling space is described by the underdetermined matrix Ax = b, 
             such that every element of x must be non-negative and sum to 1. 
             The current MCMC methods supported are Dikin Walk and Hit-and-Run. The package also provide
             tools to examine and visualize the convergence properties of the random walks.
