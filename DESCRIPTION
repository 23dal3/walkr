Description: Samples from the intersection of the n-simplex and m hyperplanes using 
             MCMC random walks. The sampling space is described by the underdetermined 
             matrix Ax = b, such that every element of x must be non-negative and 
             sum to 1. The two MCMC methods supported are Hit-and-Run and  Dikin 
             Walk. The package also provide tools to examine and visualize the 
             convergence properties of the random walks.
