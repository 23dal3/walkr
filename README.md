# walkr
Samples from the intersection of the n-simplex and m hyperplanes using MCMC methods. Specifically, 
the sampling space is described by the underdetermined matrix Ax = b, such that every element in x 
must be non-negative and must sum to 1. The current MCMC methods supported are Dikin Walk and Hit-and-Run.
